    X starting interface showing:
        button to get a new question
        status of existing question
        previous score
    - ? interface to set parameters

    X separate questions about cache parameters
    X add splitting up address apppropriately to the cache access patterns
    X ? add what is evicted to the cache access pattern question

    X selecting accesses based on % hit/miss/conflict miss target?
        should allow for huge cache problems?

    - less sensitivity for evicted answer

    X save answers button

Also consider:
    - question with C code?
